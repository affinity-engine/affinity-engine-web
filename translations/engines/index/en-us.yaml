    emberIntro: "Hi! [[pause 750]] [[expression 'default']] My name's Ember."
    diyIntro: "And I'm Diy."
    emberAffinityIntro: "And this is the Affinity Engine. [[pause 1250]] [[expression 'obviously']] A game engine, [[pause 500]] in case that isn't obvious.[[expression 'default']]"
    diyDocumentation: "The engine itself is nearly ready for <strong>beta,</strong> [[pause 250]] but there's [[pause 500]] [[expression 'embarrassed']] [[pause 750]] still a lot of documentation to write."
    emberDocumentation: "We <em>are</em> working hard on it, [[pause 250]] but we need a little more time to document its [[#expression 'proud']] [[pause 250]] (pretty big) [[pause 250]] [[/expression]] feature-set."
    diyCheckIn: "Feel free to keep checking in on us, though!"
    emberMailingList: "Or [[pause 500]] just sign up for our <strong>mailing</strong> <strong>list.</strong> [[pause 750]] [[expression 'default']] [[pause 250]] We'll let you know when the engine is ready."
    diyKickstarter: "If you sign up, [[pause 500]] we'll also let you know when we launch our Kickstarter. It'll fund a whole cast of characters and background images, [[pause 500]] all by <a href='http://daaakota.deviantart.com/' target='_blank'>Dakota Bardy</a> (whose art you should definitely checkout). [[pause 750]] All the art will be published under a <strong>Creative</strong> <strong>Commons</strong> <strong>licence</strong> so that you can use it to make your <strong>own</strong> <strong>games!</strong>"
    emberKickstarter: "And the Kickstarter will also fund [[cps *0.7]] <strong>important</strong> <strong>accessibility</strong> <strong>research.</strong>"
    diyReadMore: "Until then, [[pause 500]] feel free to read more about the engine."
    emberOpensource: "But first, [[pause 250]] I want to mention that the engine is [[cps *0.7]] entirely <strong>free</strong> and <strong>open-source.</strong>"
    diyBrowser: "And its games are highly <strong>portable.</strong> Your audience will be able to play them directly in a browser, [[pause 250]] without even installing a plugin like Unity or Flash."
    emberModular: "And the engine is <strong>modular.</strong> [[pause 750]] We may look like we're in a visual novel right now, [[pause 250]] but you can pick-and-choose modules to make many kinds of gamesâ€”games you'll <strong>love.</strong>"
    diyEasyScripts: "You don't need to be a computer scientist, either. [[pause 500]] [[expression 'default']] Once you have the engine installed, [[pause 250]] writing games is a lot like writing screenplays."
    emberBye: "So come back! [[pause 500]] Open source projects like this need community to thrive."
    diyBye: "And be sure to sign up for the mailing list! We'll let you know as soon as things are ready."
