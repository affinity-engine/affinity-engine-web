# What do we mean by *composable*? Think of an orchestra, in which a composer can arrange many musicians to work in concert with each other. With the Affinity Engine, you're the composer. You arrange small, light-weight modules together to perform in concert. You might put together just a few modules, like composing for a string quartet, or you might put together dozens or even hundreds of modules, like arranging for a full orchestra. You might also choose to go with a conventional bassoon, or replace it with an experimental theremin. As the composer, you decide what features to support in your game, and when and how they're used."
