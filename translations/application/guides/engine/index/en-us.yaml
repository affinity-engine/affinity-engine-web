        intro: "The Affinity Engine is a game engine written in JavaScript, which means its games can be played directly in a browser. It's **configurable**, **composable**, **extensible**, **accessable**, and **legible**. In other words, it's easy to pick up for novice programmers, and it's underpinnings are abstract enough that more experienced developers can painlessly extend its abilities."
