          encouragementHeader: "##### A Word of Encouragement"
          encouragement: "Getting the Affinity Engine setup can be a big process, and if you've never worked with the command line before, it'll also require you to interface with your computer in a new and challenging way. The upswing is that the Affinity Engine is built with incredibly powerful tools, and it extends that power to make game design that much easier for you. Although the setup might be daunting, bear with it and you'll have a simple, extensible, and highly customizable game engine at your disposal."
