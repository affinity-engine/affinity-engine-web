          handPickingModules: "To install the Affinity Engine by itself, simply run the above command from within your Ember.js project. (You need to do this from the [command line](/engine/installation/tooling).) Note that this is just the core of the Affinity Engine. You'll then be able to hand-pick other modules that you'll need for your game, such as the [`affinity-engine-stage`](/stage) or [`affinity-engine-menu-bar`](/menu-bar). This approach gives you the greatest control over which modules you include, which can lead to slightly svleter builds."
          bundlesHeader: "Using Bundles"
          bundles: "Bundles wrap together modules that have an affinity for each other. For instance, the [`affinity-engine-vn-bundle`]() packages the Affinity Engine along with all the modules you'll need to make a basic visual novel. Meanwhile, the [`affinity-engine-coya-bundle`]() packages the Affintiy Engine with just the modules you'll need for a choose-your-own-adventure style game. To install one of these, use `ember install`. For instance, `ember install affinity-engine-vn-bundle`."
