          defaultsEngineIntro: "At the highest level of configuration are your default values. These values are not defined by you, but by the modules you're using. For instance, the `affinity-engine` module has a default configuration that looks something like this:"
          defaultsEngineConclusion: "Note that it defines the `animationLibrary` as `jquery`. This means that unless you or another module specifies something else, your engine will use `jquery` to animate everything."
          defaultsVelocityIntro: "In the `affinity-engine-animator-velocity` plugin, the config looks something like this:"
          defaultsVelocityConclusion: "Now both the `affinity-engine` config and the `affinity-engine-animator-velocity` config define `animationLibrary`. If you include both in your project, then `affinity-engine-animator-velocity`'s config will win this conflict, since it has a higher `priority` (1 vs 0). That means that your engine will use `velocity` instead of `jquery`. However, since `affinity-engine-animator-velocity` does not specify a `menuColumns`, the engine will continue using the default defined in the `affinity-engine` config."
