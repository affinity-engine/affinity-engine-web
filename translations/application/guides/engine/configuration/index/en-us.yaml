          intro: "One of the Affinity Engine's guiding principles is *configurablity*. Every module exposes multiple points of configuration, allowing you to change the way it looks and behaves with surprising ease. For instance, if you want your dialogue boxes to use the `paper` theme, you can specify that in your configuration. If you want the game to autosave every time the player enters a new scene, you can configure that, too."
          defaultsSummary: "In this chapter, we'll first explore how [default configuration](/engine/configuration/defaults) values are set, and what happens if two modules have conflicting configurations."
          configurationTiersSummary: "After that, we'll learn how the Affinity Engine prioritizes your configuration through [*configuration tiers*](/engine/configuration/configuration-tiers). These tiers allow you to specify general theming for your project, with specific overrides when you need it. For instance, you might style most assets with the `block` style, but use the `full` style for menu interfaces."
          setupSummary: "Finally, we'll explore the different ways you can [specify](/engine/configuration/setup) your configuration, and how you can provide different configuration for different Affinity Engines running in your application."
          whatIsConfigurableHeader: "**What is Configurable?**"
          whatIsConfigurable: "Throughout this documentation, every module will have a *configuration* section specifying which attributes are configurable. If you're creating your own open-source module, be sure to document both your configurable attributes and configuration tiers so that your users can get the most out of your work."
