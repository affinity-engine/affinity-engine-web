          intro: "Fixtures are mini-configurations for reoccurring elements in your game, such as characters, backdrops, sounds effects, and songs. Within these fixtures, you'll define the essential qualities of your elements. For instance, with a character fixture, you might define their name, which images to use for them, and any overrides you have for the default config."
