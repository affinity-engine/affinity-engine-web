#### Bundles

Bundles wrap together modules that have an affinity for each other. For instance, the [`affinity-engine-visual-novel-bundle`](https://github.com/affinity-engine/affinity-engine-visual-novel-bundle) packages the Affinity Engine along with all the modules you'll need to make a basic visual novel. To install it:

```bash
ember install affinity-engine-visual-novel-bundle
```

#### Quickstarts

Quickstarts are a lot like bundles, but they do even more. A quickstart is a bare-bones Affinity Engine project with all of its routes and configs already defined. If you clone a quickstart, you can immediately start writing scripts for your game.

To use a quickstart, visit its GitHub page:

* [`affinity-engine-visual-novel-quickstart`](https://github.com/affinity-engine/affinity-engine-visual-novel-quickstart)

Once there, download the project as a zip file. Unzip it into whatever directory works for you, then run `npm install && bower install` within that directory.
