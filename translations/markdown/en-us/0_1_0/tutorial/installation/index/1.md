This chapter is broken into three sections. Check out the first section [Tooling Setup](#/api/engine/installation/tooling), if you're new to software development. It'll help you orient yourself with the command line, as well as setup important tools such as NPM, Bower, and git.

If you've never worked on an Ember project before, check out the second section, [Ember Setup](#/api/engine/installation/ember). It'll show you how to install Ember CLI and create a new Ember project.

Next, we'll look at [quickstarts and bundles](#/api/engine/installation/quickstarts), which make it much easier to get the Affinity Engine set up. Although these quickstarts are especially encouraged for new developers, experienced devs may also find them to be useful time-savers. Alternatively, you could forgo the quickstarts and bundles, instead selecting individual Affinity Engine modules to install.

Finally, we'll do a [little configuration](#/api/engine/installation/es6-support) of Ember to ensure that your game can play in any environment.

<h1>A Word of Encouragement</h1>

Installing the Affinity Engine can be a big undertaking, and if you've never worked with the command line before, it'll also require you to interface with your computer in a new and challenging way. The upswing is that the Affinity Engine is built from some of the best open-source software available, and it extends this software to make game design that much easier for you. Although the setup might be daunting, bear with it and you'll have a simple, extensible, and highly customizable game engine at your disposal.
