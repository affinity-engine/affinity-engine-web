#### Ember CLI

First, let's [install Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/user-guide/#ember-cli). Ember CLI will help you create new Ember projects, generate Affinity Engine directions, and build minified code when your game is ready for release.

#### Your First Ember Project

Now that all of Ember's dependencies are installed, we can create our first Ember project. Simply `ember new my-first-project`. This will create a new directory called `my-first-project` that contains a bare-bones Ember project. This is where your game will come to life.

Once your game is underway, you can test it locally by running `ember server` in the project directory. This command will prompt Ember CLI to build a copy of the game and serve it to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). Simply visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser to see the game in action. Whenever you save a change to your code, it'll automatically refresh the page for you so you can see the changes in action.

# Windows Users

If you're using Windows, you should follow [this guide](https://ember-cli.com/user-guide/#windows). It'll dramatically improve performance, which can be painfully slow otherwise.
