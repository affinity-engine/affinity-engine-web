# Tip Section

This section covers the command line, text editors, NPM, Bower, and git. If you're already using these tools, feel free to skip to the next section.

#### Using the Command Line

If you've never used the command line before (or you need a refresher), you might want to check out one of these tutorials. You don't need to have a deep understanding of the command line to use the Affinity Engine, but you will need to be able to navigate the file system:

* For Linux/Mac users, try the excellent [Code Academy tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).

* For users of Windows 10, you can first [install BASH](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) and then check out those [Code Academy tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).

* For users with older versions of Windows, give the [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything) article a shot.


#### Choosing a Text Editor

Writing an Affinity Engine game means writing code, and you'll need a text editor to do that. These apps are similar to word processors such Microsoft Word or LibreOffice's Writer, but whatever you do, don't use a word processor. It'll make your life much harder, as most word processors will aggressively try to reformat your code and auto-correct your function names. Instead, try one of the many free and open-source text editors out there. Here are a few popular choices:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/): an extremely user-friendly open-source project developed by Github.

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): a commercial alternative to Atom with an infinite trial period.

* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/): a command-line text editor for the masochistic power-user. Although hard to master, an experienced user can accomplish far more in it than in other text editors. (The [Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) game might ease the initial learning curve.)

#### Installing NPM

Before installing Ember, you'll need Node and the Node Package Manager (NPM). You can think of NPM as an open-source bazaar, where thousands of vendors freely distribute their open-source projects. Using NPM, you'll be able to install these code packages directly into your game, giving it new functionality that you don't have to write yourself. It's because of NPM that the Affinity Engine is able to exist as an ecosystem of modules, rather than as a single monolithic platform.

There are several ways to install Node and NPM, but let's do it the *maintainable* way. Node regularly releases new versions, and to make the updating process easier, we should use the Node Version Manager (NVM). NVM allows you to install new versions of Node with a single command, and it will manage these versions so that they don't conflict. To install NVM, [follow this guide](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script).

Once NVM is installed, you can install your first version of Node. Check [this link](https://ember-cli.com/#node) to find out which version of Node to use for best compatibility with Ember CLI. Once you've found the version you need, install it with `nvm install vx.x`. Then run `nvm alias default vx.x`. (In both cases, replacing `x.x` with the Node version number.)

#### Installing Other Global Dependencies

First, let's install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Git is a source code manager used by millions of open source projects, including Node, Ember, and the Affinity Engine itself. When you create an Affinity Engine game, it automatically uses git, which you can use to keep track of changes to your code base. For instance, if you introduce a bug in a new release of your game, you can use git to compare the old code with the new code. You could even use git to rollback your latest changes. You don't need to understand git to use the Affinity Engine, but you do need to [install it](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). If you want to learn more about this powerful tool, check out the excellent [Atlassian documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/).

Next, let's [install Bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower). Like NPM, Bower is a package manager, but with a much smaller ecosystem focused entirely on client-side code. It's easier to use and install than NPM, but both are still necessary. In fact, you need NPM to install Bower.
