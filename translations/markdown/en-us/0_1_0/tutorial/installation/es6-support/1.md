The Affinity Engine makes heavy use of ES6, the next generation JavaScript standard. In order to use the Affinity Engine, you'll need to tell Ember to enable all forms of ES6 transpiling with `babel`:

```js
// my-game/ember-cli-build.js

/*jshint node:true*/
/* global require, module */
var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
      babel: {
        includePolyfill: true,
        stage: 1
      }
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```

Note that you will not need to do this if you're using a quickstart, as ES6 is already fully enabled.
