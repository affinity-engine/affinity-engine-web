Awesome! There's now an Affinity Engine game playing directly in your browser. Unfortunately, it just has the default filler content. Let's make it do something else.

In your text editor, open the file at the path `app/affinity-engine/stage/scenes/initial.js`. Here, you'll find the script that's controlling the game. You'll notice that there's a line in the middle that looks like this:

```js
script.text('Welcome to the Affinity Engine!');
```

This is called a _direction_. Like on a theater stage, your script can direct the actors and crew to read lines of dialogue, unfurl backdrops, play sound effects, and position characters around the scene. You can learn more about directions [here](#/api/stage/directions). For the time being, let's keep it simple and change our direction to read something like this:

```js
script.text("Mic test, mic test.");
```

You can now go back to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see your updated game in action! It should look something like the demo below:
