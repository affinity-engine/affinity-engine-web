What if we want this text to behave differently. After all, this is clearly a dialogue with two characters speaking. Perhaps we can have captions for these texts to make it clear who is saying what.

As it turns out, most directions have many _commands_ that let you adjust their behavior. You'll find a full list of commands defined in the API of each direction, such as the [commands for text](#/api/stage/directions/text). In our case, we'll want to use the `name` and `namePosition` commands. For instance:

```js
yield script.text("I'd like to use your eyeliner.").name('Ember').namePosition('right');
yield script.text("Feel free!").name('Diy');
```

You'll notice that we chain these commands directly off the direction using a `.`

In addition, we can chain commands together with a `.` too, such as `name('Ember').namePosition('right')`
