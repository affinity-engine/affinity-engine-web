Wait, what's going on? It looks like the second direction executed, but not the first?

Actually, it turns out they're both executing, but because the second text executes a little after the first, it's appearing on top.

<div class="row">

<div class="with-aside small-order-2 medium-order-1">

Regardless, this isn't what we want. We want the first direction to execute, and then after it's resolved (eg. the user has clicked on it and it has disappeared), we want the second direction to fire. To do this, we use the `yield` keyword:

```js
yield script.text("Mic test, mic test.");
yield script.text("Hearing you loud and clear!");
```

</div>

<aside class="aside javascript small-order-1 medium-order-2">

# `yield`

`yield` has the unique ability to pause and resume functions. In this context, it essentially means 'wait here until this direction completes'.

</aside>

</div>
