Wait, what's going on? It looks like the second direction is executing before the first.

Actually, it turns out they're both executing, but because the second text executes a little after the first, it's appearing on top. If you click on the text it'll disappear, revealing the first text hidden beneath it.

Regardless, this isn't what we want. We want the first direction to execute, and then after it's resolved, we want the second direction to fire. To do this, we use the `yield` keyword. In this context, it essentially means 'wait until this direction completes before proceeding.'

```js
yield script.text('How would you like some quinoa salad?');
script.text('I would love some!');
```
