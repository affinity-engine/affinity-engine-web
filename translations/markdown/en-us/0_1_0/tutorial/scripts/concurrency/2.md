Oof, that's not right! Both those texts are rendering at the same time, effectively putting the second one on top of the first. Let's use the `yield` keyword to ensure that the second text direction doesn't display until the first one resolves:

```js
yield script.text('This is my first direction!');
script.text('And now that that is out of the way, let us proceed with our second direction.');
```
