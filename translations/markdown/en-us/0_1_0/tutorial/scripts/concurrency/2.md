Wait, what's going on? It looks like the second direction executed, but not the first?

Actually, it turns out they're both executing, but because the second text executes a little after the first, it's appearing on top. If you click on the text it'll disappear, revealing the first text hidden beneath it.

Regardless, this isn't what we want. We want the first direction to execute, and then after it's resolved (eg. the user has clicked on it and it has disappeared), we want the second direction to fire. To do this, we use the `yield` keyword. In this context, it essentially means 'Halt! We will wait here until this direction completes!'

```js
yield script.text("I'd like to use your eyeliner.");
script.text("Feel free!");
```
