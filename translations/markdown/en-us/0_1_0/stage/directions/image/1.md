The `image` direction will render a composite image onto the screen. The image will start with an opacity of 0, so you'll have to fade it in if you want the user to see it. Once rendered, the image can be moved about the screen using `position` or `transition`.

An `image` is composed of either a single `keyframe` or a layered composite of several `keyframes`. You can learn about keyframes and composites in the [`images` fixture section](#/stage/fixtures/images).

If a height is specified for the image, its dimensions will be altered to fit that height while maintaining its aspect ratio. If not height is specified, it will maintain its default size.
