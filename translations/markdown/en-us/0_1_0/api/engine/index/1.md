The `affinity-engine` module does very little of its own, but is essential for managing the other Affinity Engine modules. It's also the port through which you'll pass most of your configuration.

In [Usage](#/api/engine/usage) we'll get an overview of what arguments the `affinity-engine` component receives and what block params it exposes.

In [Configuration](#/api/engine/configuration) we'll learn how to define configuration files. These files alter the default attributes of your directions and componentry.

In [Fixtures](#/api/engine/fixtures) we'll learn about fixtures, which are immutable mini-configurations that you can use to define reoccurring game elements, such as characters and sound effects.
