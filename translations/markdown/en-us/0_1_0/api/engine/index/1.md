The `affinity-engine` module is the foundation for all Affinity Engine games. It bundles together the core logic of the engine, including a message bus, registrar, and configuration system.

For the time being, the most important thing is understanding is that the Affinity Engine is just a foundation. On it, you build a game out of other modules. Many of these modules are discussed in detail in this documentation, including [`affinity-engine-stage`](#/api/stage), [`affinity-engine-menu-bar`](#/menu-bar), and [`affinity-engine-plugin-data-manager-rewindable-lokijs`](#/api/plugins/data-manager-rewindable-lokijs). It's also possible to create your own modules or to use ones that other contributors have open-sourced. You can find many options on [Ember Observer](https://emberobserver.com/?query=affinity%20engine).

Once you've found the modules you want to use, you can add them to your game in a few different ways, depending on the type of module it is. [Plugins](#/api/plugins) you specify in your configuration, [components](#/api/components) you compose into your template, and other modules (such as [stage directions](#/api/stage/directions)), will become available in their own context.
