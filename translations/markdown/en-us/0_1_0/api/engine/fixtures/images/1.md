An `image` fixture can refer to either a single image or a composite of multiple keyframes.

#### State

An `image` (as well as fixtures that descend from the `image` definition, such as `characters` and `backdrops`) can support multiple states. Imagine a locker image, which can be either open or closed. When closed, you might also see some graffiti on it, such as an anarchy sign or a heart. Rather than creating a unique image for all these different states and their combinations, you can rely on the Affinity Engine itself to create a composite image. This approach can significantly reduce the file size for your game, as well as its load time.

Read through the example fixture below. By default, it will appear as a closed locker, layering the 'locker-door-closed' keyframe over the 'locker-base' keyframe. If you changed the state to `{ lock: 'closed', tag: '<3' }`, then the Affinity Engine would layer the 'locker-tag-heart' keyframe over the others. If you then changed the state to `{ lock: 'opened', tag: '<3' }`, it would replace the 'locker-door-closed' keyframe with 'locker-door-opened'. It would also remove the 'locker-tag-heart' keyframe since it needs both `tag: '<3'` and `lock: 'closed'`, and now `lock: 'opened'`.

#### Example

```js
{
  id: 'tree',
  keyframe: 'tree',
  height: 87
}, {
  id: 'locker',
  height: 72,
  layerOrder: [
    'base',
    'door',
    'graffiti'
  ],
  defaultState: { door: 'closed' },
  states: [{
    key: { door: 'closed' },
    layers: {
      door: 'locker-door-closed'
    }
  }, {
    key: { door: 'opened' },
    layers: {
      door: 'locker-door-opened'
    }
  }, {
    key: { door: 'closed', tag: 'A' },
    layers: {
      graffiti: 'locker-tag-anarchy-sign'
    }
  }, {
    key: { door: 'closed', tag: '<3' },
    layers: {
      graffiti: 'locker-tag-heart'
    }
  }]
}
```
