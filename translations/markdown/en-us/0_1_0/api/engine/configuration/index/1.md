One of the Affinity Engine's guiding principles is *configurablity*. Every module exposes multiple points of configuration, allowing you to change the way it looks and behaves with ease. For instance, if you want your dialogue boxes to use the `ae-paper` theme, you can specify that in your configuration. If you want the game to autosave every time the player enters a new scene, you can configure that, too. (Note that we're only getting an overview of how configuration works in the Affinity Engine. Later chapters will describe the specific attributes that you can configure.)

In this section, we'll first explore how [default configuration](#/api/engine/configuration/defaults) values are set, and what happens if two modules have conflicting configurations.

After that, we'll learn different ways you can [specify](#/api/engine/configuration/usage) your configuration.

Finally, we'll explore how the Affinity Engine prioritizes your configuration through [*configuration tiers*](#/api/engine/configuration/configuration-tiers). These tiers allow you to specify general theming for your project, with specific overrides when you need it. For instance, you might style most assets with the `ae-block` style, but use the `ae-full` style for menu interfaces.
