One of the Affinity Engine's guiding principles is *configurablity*. Every module exposes multiple points of configuration, allowing you to change the way it looks and behaves with ease. For instance, if you want your dialogue boxes to use the `ae-paper` theme, you can specify that in your configuration.

In [Usage](#/api/engine/configuration/usage) we'll learn how to define configs.

In [Defaults](#/api/engine/configuration/defaults) we'll learn how Affinity Engine modules define their default configurations.

In [Configuration Tiers](#/api/engine/configuration/configuration-tiers) we'll learn how to apply general theming to our project, with specific overrides for modules that need them.
