##### Overview

When clicked, the `save` button will present a modal in which players can save their game, either creating a new save or overwriting a previous one. In order to use it, our game will need a `data-manager` plugin.

##### Installation

```bash
ember install affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-save
```

##### Default Configs

Find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/affinity-engine/affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-save/blob/master/addon/affinity-engine/configs/menu-bar/button/save.js).
