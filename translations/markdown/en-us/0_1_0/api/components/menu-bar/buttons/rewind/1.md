##### Overview

When clicked, the `rewind` button will present a modal in which players can choose a previous state to rewind to. If we're using the `affinity-engine-stage`, then these previous states will be prior scenes that the player has played through. In order to use it, our game will need a `data-manager` plugin that is rewindable, such as the `affinity-engine-plugin-data-manager-rewindable-lokijs`.

##### Installation

```bash
ember install affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-rewind
```

##### Default Configs

Find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/affinity-engine/affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-rewind/blob/master/addon/affinity-engine/configs/menu-bar/button/rewind.js).

    {{affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-rewind engineId=engine.engineId}}

###### `engineId`

The unique string identifier shared between an engine and all its components. Be sure to use the same `engineId` as the one you provided to the `affinity-engine` itself.
