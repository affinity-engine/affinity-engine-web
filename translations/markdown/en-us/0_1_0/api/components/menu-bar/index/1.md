The `affinity-engine-menu-bar` component creates a menu bar that can be accessed when the mouse hovers over the edge of the screen, by default the top edge. The menu bar is empty by default, but it can yield other components, such as buttons to control your game.

In [Usage](#/api/components/menu-bar/usage) we'll learn how to install and integrate the menu bar.

In [Buttons](#/api/components/menu-bar/buttons) we'll acquaint ourselves with several buttons that you can use in your menu bar, such as `save` and `load`.
