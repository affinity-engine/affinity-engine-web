The `affinity-engine-stage` warrants its own section, even though it's just another component like the `affinity-engine-menu-bar` or `affinity-engine-curtain`. This is because many Affinity Engine game designers will spend most of their time working with the stage's `scenes`, where they can script film-like sequences of speaking characters and panning backdrops.

Specifically, the `affinity-engine-stage` creates a DOM-based 'stage' on which you can position text, characters, backgrounds, and more. It features a script-like API that makes commands to the stage human readable and easy to write. The two main concepts introduced by the `affinity-engine-stage` are `scenes` and `directions`. Both have their own sections.
