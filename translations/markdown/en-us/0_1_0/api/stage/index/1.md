The `affinity-engine-stage` creates a DOM-based 'stage' on which you can position text, characters, backgrounds, and more.

In [Usage](#/api/stage/usage) we'll learn about the arguments you can pass into the stage.

In [Scenes](#/api/stage/scenes) we'll acquaint ourselves with scenes and scripts.

in [Directions](#/api/stage/directions) we'll find a detailed API for each of the many stage directions, such as `text`, `character`, and `menu`.

in [Links](#/api/stage/links) we'll learn how to link multiple directions together to share their configuration.

In [Data](#/api/stage/data) we'll acquaint ourselves with the `data` object and how to store/retrieve information from it.
