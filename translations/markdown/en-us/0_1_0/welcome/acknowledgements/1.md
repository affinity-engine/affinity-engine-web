We want to thank the many codebases that have inspired the Affinity Engine to become what it has become:

* [Inform](http://inform7.com/): Even back in the '90s, Inform was a seedbed for pioneering game designers. Since then, it's evolved considerably, and in its most recent iteration, has made advances in semantic coding that significantly reduce barriers for new developers. While the limitations of JavaScript keep the Affinity Engine from reading like human language, Inform's rigorous push in this direction has inspired us to make software that reads as closely to a screenplay as possible.
* [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/): Largely used for writing visual novels, Ren'Py's API is quick-to-learn and easy to read. It has explored and ultimately defined what is possible within its genre, and it has been a major source of inspiration for the Affinity Engine Stage module.
