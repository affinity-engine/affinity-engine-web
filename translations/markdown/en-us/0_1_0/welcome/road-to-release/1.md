The Affinity Engine is just now entering beta, and while it has a lot to offer already (including modularity, customizability, and easy-to-use scripting interfaces), we have many goals along the way to `1.0.0`. Here are a few of the most important ones:

* Performant support for mobile, including Android devices (currently: janky)
* Integration with Cordova and Electron, making it easy to release native builds for mobile and desktop
* Executable build scripts to make it easier for new developers to get up-and-running
* Improved documentation, especially around creating custom components, plugins, and stage directions
* Exploration of variant API surfaces, particularly stage directions (this abstraction still doesn't feel 100% right)
