**The Affinity Engine** is an open-source, browser-based game engine. It's entirely **free**: no licensing, no royalties, and no price tag. And since it's browser-based, its games are de facto **cross-platform**: PCs, Macs, iPhones, Androids, you name it. In fact, that lovely little greeting Ember and Diy just gave you is itself an Affinity Engine playing in your browser.

The engine is adept at making **interactive fiction** and **visual novels**, but it has the potential to do a whole lot more. Rather than locking game designers into a single, monolothic solution, the engine actually consists of **dozens of small modules** that designers can pick and choose from. Each module adds new functionality to your game, while also exposing a simple, human-readable API that often feels like a theatrical script or screen play. In this way, the engine attempts to be both easy to use and infinitely extensible.

While the engine is currently still in beta, its API is largely stabilized and you should feel free to start making games with it today. Or, as our winsome host Diy would put it, _make games you'll love_.
