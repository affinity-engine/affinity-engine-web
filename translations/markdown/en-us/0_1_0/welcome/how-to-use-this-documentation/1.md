<h4>Navigation</h4>

The Affinity Engine isn't a single piece of software, but rather a whole ecosystem of modules that you can compose together to make highly customizable yet svelte games. This documentation is broken into several chapters, each describing in detail how to use one of these modules. You can find links to each of the chapters in the menu at the top of the screen. On mobile devices, this menu will expand and contract on a touch event.

Each chapter is further divided into numerous sections. You can navigate between them using the sidebar on larger devices, or the second expanding topbar on mobile. There's also a menu at the bottom of each page which you can use to navigate between neighboring sections and chapters.

<h4>Tips</h4>

The Affinity Engine aspires to be easy-to-use, but it still requires you to understand basic JavaScript and to master tools such as NPM, Bower, and Ember.js. While this documentation focuses on the Affinity Engine itself, it will also provide tips like the ones you see here to acquaint you with key concepts and skills.
