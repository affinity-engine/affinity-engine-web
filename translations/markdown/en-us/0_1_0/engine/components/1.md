Affinity Engine components are self-enclosed user interfaces that you can compose into your engine to add functionality. Think of a LEGO castle, where the `affinity-engine` is the mat and its components are the individual LEGO blocks. You can snap them onto the mat or even onto each other to build out the specific castle you're envisioning.

For instance, if you want to add a menu bar to your game, you might use the `affinity-engine-menu-bar` component:

```hbs
{{#affinity-engine}}
  {{affinity-engine-menu-bar}}
{{/affinity-engine}}
```

If you later want to add `affinity-engine-stage`, you could simply:

```hbs
{{#affinity-engine}}
  {{affinity-engine-menu-bar}}
  {{affinity-engine-stage}}
{{/affinity-engine}}
```

You'll find several components already available on [Ember Observer](https://emberobserver.com/?query=affinity-engine), and you can also create your own. To do so, you'll have to acquaint yourself with [Ember Components](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.9.0/components/defining-a-component/).
