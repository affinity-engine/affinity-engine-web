The first step to adding the Affinity Engine to your Ember app is to place the `affinity-engine` component in one of your templates:

```hbs
{{#affinity-engine}}
{{/affinity-engine}}
```

You can pass several properties into the component, each one described below. The `affinity-engine` can also pass properties down into its child components.

# Ember Routing

If you only plan to have a single Affinity Engine running in your project, the simplest solution is to replace the contents of `my-app/templates/application.hbs` with the `affinity-engine` component. Now your Ember project is a pure Affinity Engine. The only thing it will render is your game, and you don't need to worry about any sort of routing.

Some games may benefit from using Ember's router. If you want to learn more about how to route between multiple templates, you can consult the Ember guides [here](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.8.0/routing/). You could then render an unique engine in each route.
