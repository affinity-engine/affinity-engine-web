Affinity Engine plugins are a lot like components. They're self-enclosed snippets of logic, but without a user interface. Instead, they're used internally by the Affinity Engine to change or enhance its behavior. For instance, you might use either `affinity-engine-animator-velocity` or `affinity-engine-animator-popmotion` to use either Velocity.js or Popmotion.js to handle your animations.

Because there is no user interface for plugins, you do not have to specify them in your template like you would a component. In fact, once you install a plugin, the Affinity Engine will automatically start using it.

If you want to use different plugins for different engines, you can specify which one to use in that engine's config:

```js
{
  registrant: {
    'affinity-engine': {
      'animator': {
        path: 'service:affinity-engine/animator-velocity'
      }
    }
  }
}

```

The documentation for the individual plugins will go into specific detail about specify them in your config.
