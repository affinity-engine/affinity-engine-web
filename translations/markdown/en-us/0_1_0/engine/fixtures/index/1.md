Fixtures are mini-configurations for reoccurring elements in your game, such as characters, backdrops, sounds effects, and songs. Within these fixtures, you'll define the essential qualities of your elements. For instance, with a character fixture, you might define their name, which images to use for them, and any overrides you have for the default config.

Fixtures are defined as a simple POJO, in which each key is an array of POJOs. This `fixtures` object is then passed in directly to the `affinity-engine` component:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  fixtures: {
    characters: [{
      id: 'diy',
      name: 'Diy',
      height: 90
    }, {
      id: 'ember',
      name: 'Ember',
      height: 87
    }],
    backdrops: [{
      id: 'bedroom',
      caption: 'Their bedroom'
    }]
  }
});
```

```hbs
{{affinity-engine fixtures=fixtures}}
```
