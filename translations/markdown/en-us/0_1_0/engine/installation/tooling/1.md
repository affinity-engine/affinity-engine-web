#### Using the Command Line

If you've never used the command line before (or you need a refresher), you might want to check out one of these tutorials. You don't need to have a deep understanding of the command line to use the Affinity Engine, but you will need to be able to navigate the file system:

* For Linux/Mac users, try the excellent [Code Academy tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).

* For users of Windows 10, you can first [install BASH](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) and then check out those [Code Academy tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).

* For users with older versions of Windows, give the [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything) article a shot.


#### Choosing a Text Editor

Writing an Affinity Engine game means writing code, and you'll need a text editor to do that. These apps are similar to word processors such Microsoft Word or LibreOffice's Writer, but whatever you do, don't use a word processor. It'll make your life much harder, as most word processors will aggressively try to reformat your code and auto-correct your function names. Instead, try one of the many free and open-source text editors out there. Here are a few popular choice:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/): an extremely user-friendly open-source project developed by Github.

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): a commercial alternative to Atom with an infinite trial period.

* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/): a command-line text editor for the masochistic power-user. Although hard to master, an experienced user can accomplish far more in it than in other text editors. (The [Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) game might ease the initial learning curve.)
