```bash
ember install affinity-engine
```

To install the Affinity Engine by itself, simply run the above command from within your Ember.js project. (You need to do this from the [command line](/engine/installation/tooling).) Note that this is just the core of the Affinity Engine. You'll then be able to hand-pick other modules that you'll need for your game, such as the [`affinity-engine-stage`](/stage) or [`affinity-engine-menu-bar`](/menu-bar). This approach gives you the greatest control over which modules you include, which can lead to slightly svleter builds.

Alternatively, you can use the bundles and quickstarts described in the next section.
