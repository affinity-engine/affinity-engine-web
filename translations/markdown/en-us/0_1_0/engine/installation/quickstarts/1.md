#### Bundles

Bundles wrap together modules that have an affinity for each other. For instance, the [`affinity-engine-vn-bundle`](https://github.com/affinity-engineaffinity-engine-vn-bundle) packages the Affinity Engine along with all the modules you'll need to make a basic visual novel. Meanwhile, the [`affinity-engine-coya-bundle`](https://github.com/affinity-engineaffinity-engine-coya-bundle) packages the Affintiy Engine with just the modules you'll need for a choose-your-own-adventure style game. To install one of these, use `ember install`. For instance, `ember install affinity-engine-vn-bundle`.

#### Quickstarts

Quickstarts are a lot like bundles, but they do even more. A quickstart is a bare-bones Affinity Engine project with all of its routes and configs already defined. If you clone a quickstart, you can immediately start writing scripts for your game, rather than going through the setup process detailed in the rest of the `engine` chapter.

To use a quickstart, visit its GitHub page:

* [`affinity-engine-vn-quickstart`](https://github.com/affinity-engineaffinity-engine-vn-quickstart)
* [`affinity-engine-coya-quickstart`](https://github.com/affinity-engineaffinity-engine-coya-quickstart)

Once there, download the project as a zip file. Unzip it into whatever directory works for you, then run `npm install && bower install` within that directory. After that, you can skip straight to the `stage` chapter of this documentation.
