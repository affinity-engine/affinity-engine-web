This chapter is broken into four sections. Check out the first section, [Tooling Setup](/engine/installation/tooling), if you're new to software development. It'll help you get oriented with the command line and text editors, as well as setup with important tools such as NPM, Bower, and git.

If you've never worked on an Ember project before, check out the second section, [Ember Setup](/engine/installation/ember). It'll show you how to install Ember CLI and create a new Ember project.

Next, you'll learn how to [install the Affinity Engine](/engine/installation/affinity-engine) itself.

And in the final section, we'll look at [quickstarts and bundles](/engine/installation/quickstarts), which make it much easier to get the Affinity Engine setup. Although these quickstarts are especially encouraged for new developers, experienced devs may also find them to be useful time-savers.

<h1>A Word of Encouragement</h1>

Installing the Affinity Engine can be a big undertaking, and if you've never worked with the command line before, it'll also require you to interface with your computer in a new and challenging way. The upswing is that the Affinity Engine is built with incredibly powerful tools, and it extends that power to make game design that much easier for you. Although the setup might be daunting, bear with it and you'll have a simple, extensible, and highly customizable game engine at your disposal.
