The `affinity-engine` exposes several block params which can be passed down to its children:

```hbs
{{#affinity-engine as |engine|}}
  {{affinity-engine-stage engineId=engine.engineId}}
{{/affinity-engine}}
```

The params include:

* `engineId`: an unique string identifier for the engine.

* `isLoaded`: a boolean that tracks the current state of the preloading process; it is initially `false`.

##### Preloader Params Example

If you're using the `affintiy-engine-curtain` to preload your assets, it might look like:

```hbs
{{#affinity-engine as |engine|}}
  {{#if engine.isLoaded}}
    <p>The game is loaded!</p>
  {{else}}
    {{affinity-engine-curtain}}
  {{/if}}
{{/affinity-engine}}
```

# Preloading Assets

Due to the nature of the web, media assets like images and music files won't start downloading until they're being used. For instance, an image won't start downloading until it would appear on screen. This can lead to visual flickers and audio hick-ups, even over fast connections. The `affinity-engine` component can coordinate with a preloader module to fix this.
