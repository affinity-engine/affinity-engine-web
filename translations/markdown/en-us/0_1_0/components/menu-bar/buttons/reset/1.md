##### Overview

When clicked, the `reset` button will restart the engine. If an `affinity-engine-stage` is present, the stage will return to its initial scene.

##### Installation

```bash
ember install affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-reset
```

##### Usage

```hbs
{{#affinity-engine engineId="queers-in-space" as |engine|}}
  {{#affinity-engine-stage engineId=engine.engineId}}
  {{#affinity-engine-menu-bar engineId=engine.engineId}}
    {{affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-reset engineId=engine.engineId}}
  {{/affinity-engine-menu-bar}}
{{/affinity-engine}}
```

##### Arguments

###### `engineId`

The unique string identifier shared between an engine and all its components. Be sure to use the same `engineId` as the one you provided to the `affinity-engine` itself.
