##### Overview

When clicked, the `save` button will present a modal in which players can save their game, either creating a new save or overwriting a previous one. In order to use it, your game will need a `data-manager` plugin.

##### Installation

```bash
ember install affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-save
```

##### Usage

```hbs
{{#affinity-engine engineId="queers-in-space" as |engine|}}
  {{#affinity-engine-stage engineId=engine.engineId}}
  {{#affinity-engine-menu-bar engineId=engine.engineId}}
    {{affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-save engineId=engine.engineId}}
  {{/affinity-engine-menu-bar}}
{{/affinity-engine}}
```

##### Arguments

###### `engineId`

The unique string identifier shared between an engine and all its components. Be sure to use the same `engineId` as the one you provided to the `affinity-engine` itself.
