The `affinity-engine-menu-bar` component creates a menu bar that can be accessed when the mouse hovers over the edge of the screen, by default the top edge. This menu bar can contain components of its own, and is a particularly good place to put buttons. You'll find instructions in the buttons section for using the `save`, `load`, and other buttons, but as with most aspects of the Affinity Engine, it's also easy to create your own.

#### Installation

```bash
ember install affinity-engine-menu-bar
```

#### Usage

```hbs
{{#affinity-engine engineId="queers-in-space" as |engine|}}
  {{#affinity-engine-stage engineId=engine.engineId}}
  {{#affinity-engine-menu-bar engineId=engine.engineId}}
    {{affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-load engineId=engine.engineId}}
    {{affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-save engineId=engine.engineId}}
    {{affinity-engine-menu-bar-button-reset engineId=engine.engineId}}
  {{/affinity-engine-menu-bar}}
{{/affinity-engine}}
```

#### Arguments

##### `engineId`

The unique string identifier shared between an engine and all its components. Be sure to use the same `engineId` as the one you provided to the `affinity-engine` itself.
