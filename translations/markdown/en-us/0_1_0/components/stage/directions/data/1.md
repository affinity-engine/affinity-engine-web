The `data` direction can store and retrieve data between scenes and even persist it after the browser is closed. For instance, if the user provides a name for the main character, you can store that name using the `data` direction.

##### Installation

```bash
ember install affinity-engine-stage-direction-data
```

##### Usage

```js
export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    // 'key' was previous set to 'foo'
    const value = yield script.data('key');

    console.log(value); // prints 'foo'
  }
});
```

###### Arguments

* `key`: (**String**)

###### Return

Returns a [PromisedDirection](/components/stage/directions#promised_direction) that resolves when the data is retrieved.
