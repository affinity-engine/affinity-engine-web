The `data` direction can store and retrieve data between scenes and even persist it after the browser is closed. For instance, if the user provides a name for the main character, you can store that name using the `data` direction.

##### Installation

```bash
ember install affinity-engine-stage-direction-data
```

#### Usage

```js
export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    const value = yield script.data('key');
  }
});
```

Retrieve a stored value. `data` returns a Promise that resolves with the stored value.

* `key`: (**String**)
