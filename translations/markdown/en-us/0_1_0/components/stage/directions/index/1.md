#### Overview

Directions are your main way of communicating with the stage. For instance, if you want to put a character on the stage, you might use the `character` direction:

```js
start: task(function * (script) {
  script.character('diy');
})
```

#### Commands

You can chain commands onto most directions, changing the way they behave. For instance, if you want your character to fade into the middle of the screen, you might:

```js
start: task(function * (script) {
  script.character('diy').position('center').fadeIn();
})
```

Every direction has its own set of commands, so be sure to consult the API for the specific direction you're using.

#### Links

You can also link directions together using an underscore, `_`. For instance, if you link a `text` direction off of a `character`, then the `text` direction will configure its behavior based on the `character`:

```js
start: task(function * (script) {
  const diy = script.character('diy').position('center').fadeIn(); // the 'diy' fixture has the `name` 'Diy'

  yield diy._.text('I have a name'); // the text's name box displays 'Diy'
  yield script.text('I have no name.'); // the text's name box is not rendered
  yield script.text('I have a name, but only because I manually specified it.').name('Ember');  // the text's name box displays 'Ember'
})
```

In this case, the `text` that is linked off of Diy will display the name associated with the `diy` fixture. The `text` that comes directly from the `script` will have no name, unless one is manually specified.

#### `PromisedDirection`

Most directions return a `PromisedDirection` instance. These instances will resolve like Promises, but also have all the commands of a Direction. This allows you to both await their resolution:

```js
yield script.text('Hello world');
```

As well as to chain commands off them:

```js
const text = script.text('Hello world');

. . . .

text.close();
```
