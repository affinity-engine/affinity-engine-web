The `pause` direction pauses the script.

##### Installation

```bash
ember install affinity-engine-stage-direction-pause
```

##### Usage

```js
export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    yield script.pause(1000, 'KeyA');
  }
});
```

Pause the script. If you provide multiple arguments to this direction, then the promise will resolve as soon as any of those arguments is satisfied.

1. String: the name of a keyboard key; when this key is pressed, the promise will resolve.
2. Number: a duration in milliseconds until the pause completes.
3. Promise: when the promise resolves, so does the pause.
