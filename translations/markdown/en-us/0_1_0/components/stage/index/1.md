The `affinity-engine-stage` component creates a DOM-based 'stage' on which you can position text, characters, backgrounds, and more. It features a script-like API that makes commands to the stage human readable and easy to write. The two main concepts introduced by the `affinity-engine-stage` are `scenes` and `directions`. Both have their own sections.
