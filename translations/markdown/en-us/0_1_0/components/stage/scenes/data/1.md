##### Overview

The `data` object is the key to sharing information between scenes, sessions, and even save games. For instance, you might get the player's name like so:

```js
start: task(function * (script) {
  const name = yield script.menu([{ inputable: true }]).text('What is your name?');

  yield script.text(`Hi, ${name.value}`);
})
```

The problem is, once you move to the next scene, you'll have lost that variable. This is where the `data` object comes in handy:

```js
start: task(function * (script, data) {
  const name = yield script.menu([{ inputable: true }]).text('What is your name?');

  data.set('name', name.value);

  yield script.text(`Hi, ${name.value}.`);
})
```

In a subsequent scene, you can then:

```js
start: task(function * (script, data) {
  yield script.text(`Hello again, ${data.get('name')}!`);
})
```

This data is also persisted into long-term storage, meaning that players can reload the page and their name will not be lost.

##### Shared Data

When interacting with the `data` object, you're only changing data specific to the current save game. If the player starts a whole new game, a new `data` object will be created for that game. This is ideal in most situations, as it will keep the choices players make in one game from leaking over into another. However, you might want to share some data between games, such as which achievements have been unlocked, what controls the player has configured for themselves, and whether they've unlocked a New Game+. You can accomplish this by grabbing the shared data object:

```js
const shared = data.getSharedData();
```

Once you have it, you can interact with it just like the standard `data` object:

```js
const shared = data.getSharedData();

shared.set('gameCompletedAchievement', true);
shared.incrementProperty('timesCompleted');

shared.save();
```

Unlike the standard `data` object, which automatically persists its data between scenes, shared data must be manually persisted by calling `save`.

##### API

The `data` object is an extended version of Ember's `ObjectProxy`, with an API comparable to [`Ember.Object`](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Object.html). This section will present several of the most essential functions that an `Ember.Object` provides, as well as the unique functions of the `data` object, `min`, `max`, and `getSharedData`.
