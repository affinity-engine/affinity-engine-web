By default, the Affinity Engine will save progress at the start of each scene. If you have disabled this in your config, you can call `autosave` on the scene to trigger the save functionality. Alternatively, you can pass `false` into the argument to disable the autosave for the incoming scene.

* `autosave` (**Boolean**|Default: true): whether to autosave.
