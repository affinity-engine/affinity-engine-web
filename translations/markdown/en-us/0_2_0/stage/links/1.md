### Overview

You can link directions together using an underscore, `_`. For instance, if you link a `text` direction off of a `character`, then the `text` direction will configure its behavior based on the `character`:

```js
// app/affinity-engine/fixtures/characters/diy.js
{
  id: 'diy',
  links: {
    global: {
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Diy',
        captionPosition: 'left'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```js
// app/affinity-engine/stage/scenes/start.js
start: task(function * (script) {
  const diy = script.character('diy').fadeIn(); // the 'diy' fixture has the `name` 'Diy'

  yield diy._.text('I have a name'); // the text's caotui box displays 'Diy'
  yield script.text('I have no name.'); // the text's caption box is not rendered
  yield script.text('I have a name, but only because I manually specified it.', { caption: 'Ember' });  // the text's caption box displays 'Ember'
})
```

In this case, the `text` that is linked off of Diy will display the caption associated with the `diy` fixture. The `text` that comes directly from the `script` will have no caption, unless one is manually specified.

### Configuring Links

#### Fixtures

You can define links in your fixtures, such as this link for the `character` Diy:

```js
// app/affinity-engine/fixtures/characters/diy.js
{
  id: 'diy',
  links: {
    global: {
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Diy',
        captionPosition: 'left'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As with [configuration tiers](#/engine/configuration/configuration-tiers), you can also provide more specific links definitions:

```js
// app/affinity-engine/fixtures/characters/diy.js
{
  id: 'diy',
  links: {
    global: {
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Diy',
        captionPosition: 'left'
      }
    },
    component: {
      stage: {
        text: {
          attrs: {
            captionPosition: 'left'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Configuration

If you wish to always link attributes from a particular direction type, you can also provide links in the configuration files themselves:

```js
// app/affinity-engine/configs/main.js
{
  component: {
    stage: {
      direction: {
        text: {
          attrs: {
            captionPosition: 'right'
          }
        },
        character: {
          links: {
            global: {
              attrs: {
                captionPosition: 'center'
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, a `text` linking off a `character` will position its caption in the center, while a `text` that isn't linked off a `character` will position its caption to the right.
