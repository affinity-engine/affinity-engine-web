The `backdrop` direction extends the [`image` direction](#/stage/directions/image). It has all the same commands and behavior as an `image`, but is rendered in the `background` layer and uses [`backdrop` fixtures](#/engine/fixtures/backdrops).

##### Layer

`stage.image.background`

##### Configuration Tiers

* component.stage.direction.backdrop
* backdrop
* component.stage.direction.image
* image
* component.stage.direction.every
* component.stage.every
* global

##### Installation

```bash
ember install affinity-engine-stage-direction-backdrop
```

##### Usage

```js
export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    script.backdrop('fixtureId');
  }
});
```

###### Arguments

* `fixtureId` (**String**): a [backdrop fixture](#/engine/fixtures/backdrops) id.

###### Return

Returns a [PromisedDirection](#/stage/directions?anchor=promised_direction) that resolves when the animation queue completes.
