Autosaves are created whenever the player arrives at a checkpoint, such as a new scene. Players can load auto saves like they would any other save state.

This attribute determines many autosaves will be recorded. If the number is ever exceeded, the oldest autosave will be overwritten.

If you want no autosaves, simply set this value to 0.
