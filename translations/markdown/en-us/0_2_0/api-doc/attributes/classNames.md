Changes the CSS class names associated with the direction. You can specify the class names as a string, array, or object:
  * String: replaces the current class names.
  * Array: transforms the array into a string and replaces the current class names.
  * Object: merges the class names in the object with any class name objects defined elsewhere in the configuration.

If you use the `affinity-engine-style-bundle` (which comes with most quickstarts and bundles), then you automatically have access to three decorative styles and two structural styles:

  * Decorative
    * `ae-coastal`
    * `ae-paper`
    * `ae-transparent`
  * Structural
    * `ae-block`
    * `ae-full`

You can also define your own CSS classes in your stylesheets.
