What if we want this text to behave differently. After all, this is clearly a dialogue with two characters speaking. Perhaps we can have captions for these texts to make it clear who is saying what.

As it turns out, most directions have many _attributes_ that let you adjust their behavior. You'll find a full list of attributes defined in the API of each direction, such as the [attributes for text](#/api/stage/directions/text). In our case, we'll want to use the `caption` and `captionPosition` attributes. We pass these to the direction as our final argument. For instance:

```js
yield script.text("Mic test, mic test.", { caption: 'Diy' });
yield script.text("Hearing you loud and clear!", { caption: 'Ember', captionPosition: 'right' });
```

# POJOs

Notice the curly braces (`{}`)? Those initialize a plain ol' JavaScript object (POJO), which is kind of like a dictionary. It's filled with entries, such as 'caption' or 'captionPosition', which have definitions like 'Ember' and 'right'. In this case, the Affinity Engine knows to look for 'caption' and 'captionPosition', and use their values to change the way a `text` direction works.
