If you refresh the page, you'll find that the game will resume from the last scene you were on. Sometimes, this isn't desirable, so you can pass the `autosave: false` option to the scene:

```js
script.scene('curtains', { autosave: false });
```

```js
script.scene('show', { autosave: false });
```
