So far, we've been writing our whole script in a single file, `app/affinity-engine/stage/scenes/initial`. For such a tiny game, that's fine. However, as the game grows, it'll get harder to navigate a single large scene. Instead, you can divide the dialogue into numerous scenes. This has a side-benefit, too: each scene is a natural checkpoint, and when players return to the game, it'll automatically pick up from the start of the last scene they visited.

Once you define a scene, you can send the player to it with the `scene` direction:

```js
// app/affinity-engine/stage/scenes/initial.js
import { Scene } from 'affinity-engine-stage';
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';

export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    const diy = script.character({
      links: {
        all: {
          attrs: {
            caption: 'Diy'
          }
        }
      }
    });
    const ember = script.character({
      links: {
        all: {
          attrs: {
            caption: 'Ember',
            captionPosition: 'right'
          }
        },
        component: {
          stage: {
            direction: {
              text: {
                attrs: {
                  classNames: 'ae-paper ae-block'
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    });

    yield diy._.text("Mic test, mic test.");
    const choice1 = yield script.menu(["Hearing you load and clear!", "There's some bad static!", "The volume is too low!"]);
    yield ember._.text(choice1.text);

    yield diy._.text("How about now?");
    const choice2 = yield script.menu(["That's better!", "That's worse!"]);
    yield ember._.text(choice2.text);

    script.scene('curtains');
  })
});
```

```js
// app/affinity-engine/stage/scenes/curtains.js
import { Scene } from 'affinity-engine-stage';
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';

export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    const diy = script.character({
      links: {
        all: {
          attrs: {
            caption: 'Diy'
          }
        }
      }
    });
    const ember = script.character({
      links: {
        all: {
          attrs: {
            caption: 'Ember',
            captionPosition: 'right'
          }
        },
        component: {
          stage: {
            direction: {
              text: {
                attrs: {
                  classNames: 'ae-paper ae-block'
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    });

    yield script.text("An hour later. . . .");
    yield ember._.text("I'm just wrapping up over here. You ready, Diy? We've got curtains in 10.");
    yield diy._.text("Yeah, just finished. Want any help?");

    script.scene('show');
  })
});
```

```js
// app/affinity-engine/stage/scenes/curtains.js
import { Scene } from 'affinity-engine-stage';
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';

export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    const ember = script.character({
      links: {
        all: {
          attrs: {
            caption: 'Ember',
            captionPosition: 'right'
          }
        },
        component: {
          stage: {
            direction: {
              text: {
                attrs: {
                  classNames: 'ae-paper ae-block'
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    });

    yield script.text("10 minutes later. . . .");
    yield ember._.text("Hello everyone! Thanks for coming out!");
  })
});
```
