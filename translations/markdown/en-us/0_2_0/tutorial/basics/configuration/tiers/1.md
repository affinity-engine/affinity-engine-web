Let's say that you want the dialogue to be a little more interactive. For instance, rather than Ember simply saying that she can hear Diy loud and clear, you want her to offer them other forms of feedback. We can use the _menu_ direction to provide those choices:

```js
yield script.text('Mic test, mic test.', { caption: 'Diy' });
const choice = yield script.menu(["Hearing you load and clear!", "There's some bad static!", "The volume is too low!"]);
yield script.text(choice.text, { caption: 'Ember', captionPosition: 'right' });
```

We'll go into more detail about how the menu direction works in future tutorials. For the time being, check out the demo and notice how the menu is also `'ae-coastal'`:
