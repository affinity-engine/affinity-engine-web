Let's say that our designer has one more request: they want all text and menu directions to slide off the screen instead of fading. If we look back at the configuration tiers, we see that at the `component.stage.direction.prompt` level, we can specify both of them. Let's do that:

```js
// app/affinity-engine/config.js
export default {
  component: {
    stage: {
      direction: {
        prompt: {
          attrs: {
            transitionOut: {
              effect: {
                translateX: '-100%'
              }
            }
          }
        },
        text: {
          attrs: {
            classNames: 'ae-coastal ae-block'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

Just like with `component.stage.direction.text`, we create a nested configuration object and then specify our attribute inside of `attrs`. Don't worry about the particulars of `transitionOut` just yet, though. The lesson here is that configuration tiers allow us to configure directions broadly (with tiers like `all`), hyper-specifically (with tiers like `component.stage.direction.text`), and somewhere in between (with shared tiers like `component.stage.direction.prompt`).
