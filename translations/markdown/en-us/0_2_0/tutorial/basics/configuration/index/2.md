While that works, it'll get tedious as our game grows to hundreds or even thousands of lines. On top of that, if our designer later decides that they want to use a different style, it will take a long time to go in and manually change.

To make our lives easier, we can use a _config_ instead. Navigate to `app/affinity-engine/config.js`, where you'll find an empty config object like so:

```js
export default {

};
```

If we want to set all directions' `classNames` attribute to `'ae-coastal ae-block'` by default, we could change that config file like so:

```js
export default {
  all: {
    attrs: {
      classNames: 'ae-coastal ae-block'
    }
  }
};
```

Configurations placed under `all` will apply to _all_ directions. Since we want to configure an _attribute_, we place it under `attrs`.

And then back in our script, we can remove the `classNames: 'ae-coastal ae-block'`:

```js
yield script.text("Mic test, mic test.", { caption: 'Diy' });
yield script.text("Hearing you loud and clear!", { caption: 'Ember', captionPosition: 'right' });
```
