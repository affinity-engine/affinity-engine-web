The default text style is called `'ae-paper ae-block'`. But let's say our designer wants something a little calmer, perhaps the bluish `'ae-coastal'` theme. One option would be to manually apply it to all text directions:

```js
yield script.text("Mic test, mic test.", { caption: 'Diy', classNames: 'ae-coastal ae-block' });
yield script.text("Hearing you loud and clear!", { caption: 'Ember', captionPosition: 'right', classNames: 'ae-coastal ae-block' });
```
