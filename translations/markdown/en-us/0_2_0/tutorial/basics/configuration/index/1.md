The default text style is beautiful, isn't it? (Side note, we'll learn more about styles later. For the time being, know that the default is called `'ae-paper ae-block'`.) But let's say your designer wants something a little calmer, perhaps the bluish `'ae-coastal'` theme. One option would be to manually apply it to all text directions:

```js
yield script.text("Mic test, mic test.", { caption: 'Diy', classNames: 'ae-coastal ae-block' });
yield script.text("Hearing you loud and clear!", { caption: 'Ember', captionPosition: 'right', classNames: 'ae-coastal ae-block' });
```
