In the last section, we wrote several scenes, and in each one, we had to redefine our characters and their links. Once again, this gets tedious and brittle if we rely on it. Instead, we can use _fixtures_. These are like mini-config files that we can reference from any scene.

To create fixtures for Diy and Ember, let's open the `app/affinity-engine/fixtures/characters.js` file and enter:

```js
export default [{
  id: 'diy',
  links: {
    all: {
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Diy'
      }
    }
  }
}, {
  id: 'ember',
  links: {
    all: {
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Ember',
        captionPosition: 'right'
      }
    },
    component: {
      stage: {
        direction: {
          text: {
            attrs: {
              classNames: 'ae-paper ae-block'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}];
```

And now that that's done, we can specify our character fixtures by their `id`, such as 'diy' and 'ember':

```js
const diy = script.character('diy');
const ember = script.character('ember');

yield diy._.text("Mic test, mic test.");
const choice1 = yield script.menu(["Hearing you load and clear!", "There's some bad static!", "The volume is too low!"]);
yield ember._.text(choice1.text);

yield diy._.text("How about now?");
const choice2 = yield script.menu(["That's better!", "That's worse!"]);
yield ember._.text(choice2.text);

script.scene('curtains');
```

The beautiful thing about this approach is that we'll now be able to reference these characters (with all of their qualities) using just their `id`. This will become especially useful as your character fixtures grow more complex.
