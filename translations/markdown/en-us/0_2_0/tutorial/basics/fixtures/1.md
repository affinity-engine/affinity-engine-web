In the last section, we wrote several scenes, and in each one, we had to redefine our characters and their links. Once again, this gets tedious and brittle if we rely on it. Instead, we can use _fixtures_. These are like mini-config files that we can reference from any scene.

To create fixtures for Diy and Ember, let's open the `app/affinity-engine/fixtures/characters.js` file and enter:

```js
export default [{
  id: 'diy',
  links: {
    all: {
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Diy'
      }
    }
  }
}, {
  id: 'ember',
  links: {
    all: {
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Ember',
        captionPosition: 'right'
      }
    },
    component: {
      stage: {
        direction: {
          text: {
            attrs: {
              classNames: 'ae-paper ae-block'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}];
```

And now that that's done, we can specify our character fixtures by their `id`, such as 'diy' and 'ember':

```js
// app/affinity-engine/stage/scenes/initial.js
import { Scene } from 'affinity-engine-stage';
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';

export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    const diy = script.character('diy');
    const ember = script.character('ember');

    yield diy._.text("Mic test, mic test.");
    const choice1 = yield script.menu(["Hearing you load and clear!", "There's some bad static!", "The volume is too low!"]);
    yield ember._.text(choice1.text);

    yield diy._.text("How about now?");
    const choice2 = yield script.menu(["That's better!", "That's worse!"]);
    yield ember._.text(choice2.text);

    script.scene('curtains');
  })
});
```

```js
// app/affinity-engine/stage/scenes/curtains.js
import { Scene } from 'affinity-engine-stage';
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';

export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    const diy = script.character('diy');
    const ember = script.character('ember');

    yield script.text("An hour later. . . .");
    yield ember._.text("I'm just wrapping up over here. You ready, Diy? We've got curtains in 10.");
    yield diy._.text("Yeah, just finished. Want any help?");

    script.scene('show');
  })
});
```

```js
// app/affinity-engine/stage/scenes/curtains.js
import { Scene } from 'affinity-engine-stage';
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';

export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    const ember = script.character('ember');

    yield script.text("10 minutes later. . . .");
    yield ember._.text("Hello everyone! Thanks for coming out!");
  })
});
```

Doesn't that clean the scenes up nicely?
