Although that works fine, imagine that we now have hundreds or thousands of lines of dialogue. It would get tedious to pass in the `{ caption: 'Ember', captionPosition: 'right' }` attributes each time. Instead, we can define our two characters before the dialogue starts and then use _links_ to configure the text:

```js
const diy = script.character({
  links: {
    all: {
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Diy'
      }
    }
  }
});
const ember = script.character({
  links: {
    all: {
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Ember',
        captionPosition: 'right'
      }
    }
  }
});

yield diy._.text("Mic test, mic test.");
const choice1 = yield script.menu(["Hearing you load and clear!", "There's some bad static!", "The volume is too low!"]);
yield ember._.text(choice1.text);

yield diy._.text("How about now?");
const choice2 = yield script.menu(["That's better!", "That's worse!"]);
yield ember._.text(choice2.text);
```

Once the characters are defined, we can link off of them with an _underscore_ (`_`). So, `diy._.text` instead of `script.text`.

The end result plays identically to the demo above, but will be far easier to expand and maintain:
