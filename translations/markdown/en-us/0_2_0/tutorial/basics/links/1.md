Let's say that we now want the dialogue to continue. Maybe something like this:

```js
yield script.text('Mic test, mic test.', { caption: 'Diy' });
const choice1 = yield script.menu(["Hearing you load and clear!", "There's some bad static!", "The volume is too low!"]);
yield script.text(choice1.text, { caption: 'Ember', captionPosition: 'right' });

yield script.text("How about now?", { caption: 'Diy' });
const choice2 = yield script.menu(["That's better!", "That's worse!"]);
yield script.text(choice2.text, { caption: 'Ember', captionPosition: 'right' });
```
