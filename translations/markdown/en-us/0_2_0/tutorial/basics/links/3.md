Links are a lot like configurations, only you can specify them on a per-line basis. To that end, let's say your designer wants Ember's text to be styled like the menus. You could do that like so:

```js
const ember = script.character({
  links: {
    all: {
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Ember',
        captionPosition: 'right'
      }
    },
    component: {
      stage: {
        direction: {
          text: {
            attrs: {
              classNames: 'ae-paper ae-block'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```
