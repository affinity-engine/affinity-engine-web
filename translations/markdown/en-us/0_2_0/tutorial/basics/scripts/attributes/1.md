What if we want this text to behave differently. After all, this is clearly a dialogue with two characters speaking. Perhaps we can have captions for these texts to make it clear who is saying what.

As it turns out, most directions have many _attributes_ that let you adjust their behavior. You'll find a full list of attributes defined in the API of each direction, such as the [attributes for text](#/api/stage/directions/text). In our case, we'll want to use the `caption` and `captionPosition` attributes. For instance:

```js
yield script.text("Mic test, mic test.", { caption: 'Diy' });
script.text("Hearing you loud and clear!", { caption: 'Ember', captionPosition: 'right' });
```
