You can record the player's choice like so:

```js
const food = yield script.menu(['How about some kale?', 'I could use some kimchi.', 'I love almonds.'], { text: 'What would you like?' });
```

`food` has three values: `key`, `text`, and `value`. In this simple case, `key` will be the index of the item, starting at `0` for 'How about some kale?', then progressing upwards to `1` for 'I could use some kimchi' and `2` for 'I love almonds'. `text` and `value` will both be the text of the selection.

Let's see it in action:

```js
const food = yield script.menu(['How about some kale?', 'I could use some kimchi.', 'I love almonds.']);

yield script.text(food.key);
yield script.text(food.text);
yield script.text(food.value);
```
