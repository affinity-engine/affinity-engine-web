Now that we know what the player wants, we should find how _how much_ they want using a slider:

```js
const food = yield script.menu([{
  key: 'kale',
  text: 'How about some kale?'
}, {
  key: 'kimchi',
  text: 'I could use some kimchi.'
}, {
  key: 'almonds',
  text: 'I love almonds.'
}, {
  key: 'custom',
  text: 'I want something else.',
  inputable: true
}]);

const amount = yield script.menu([{
  text: 'How much do you want?',
  slider: {
    showValue: true,
    start: 1,
    range: {
      min: 1,
      max: 100
    }
  }
}, {
  key: 'multiSubmit',
  text: 'Select Amount',
  multiSubmit: true
}])

yield script.text(amount.key);
yield script.text(amount.text);
yield script.text(amount.value);
yield script.text(amount.selections[0].value);

```

Note that we have to provide a `multiSubmit` button for the user to click after they've selected the amount they want. We're also able to provide a lot of options to the slider, such as it's `start` value and `range`. You can learn about all the available options in the [`ember-cli-nouislider` documentation](http://kennethkalmer.github.io/ember-cli-nouislider/#/options).
