You'll notice that `food.key` is no longer `0`, `1`, or `2`, but the much more meaningful keys we provided: `kale`, `kimchi`, and `almonds`. We can use that value to do something in response to the user's choice:

```js
const food = yield script.menu([{
  key: 'kale',
  text: 'How about some kale?'
}, {
  key: 'kimchi',
  text: 'I could use some kimchi.'
}, {
  key: 'almonds',
  text: 'I love almonds.'
}]);

switch (food.key) {
  case 'kale': yield script.text('Sure, I could get you some kale.'); break;
  case 'kimchi': yield script.text('Having some stomach problems? I hear kimchi helps.'); break;
  case 'almonds': yield script.text('Yeah? I love almonds, too!'); break;
}
```
