Sometimes you'll want to work with values that have more meaning than the item's index and are less bulky than the full text. To do that, we can manually provide a `key` and `text`. For instance:

```js
const food = yield script.menu([{
  key: 'kale',
  text: 'How about some kale?'
}, {
  key: 'kimchi',
  text: 'I could use some kimchi.'
}, {
  key: 'almonds',
  text: 'I love almonds.'
}]);

yield script.text(food.key);
yield script.text(food.text);
yield script.text(food.value);
```
