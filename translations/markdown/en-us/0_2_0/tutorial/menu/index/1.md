If you're making a visual novel or COYA-style game, the main form of player interaction will probably be through _menus_, like the one you see in the demo below. In this chapter, we'll get an overview of how menus work and what they can do.

You can also find the full documentation for the `menu` direction [here](/#/api/stage/directions/menu).

<div class="row">

<div class="with-aside small-order-2 medium-order-1">

For the time being, let's create a simple menu. To do so, we simply pass in an array of strings:

```js
import { Scene } from 'affinity-engine-stage';
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';

export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    yield script.menu(['How about some kale?', 'I could use some kimchi.', 'I love almonds.']);
  })
});
```

</div>

<aside class="aside javascript small-order-1 medium-order-2">

# Arrays

Arrays are ordered lists, whether of strings, numbers, objects, or even `null` or `undefined`. In JavaScript, we normally create arrays by starting with an open square-bracket (`[`), providing the comma separated list, and then closing with the `]`. In this case, the array looks like: `['How about some kale?', 'I could use some kimchi.', 'I love almonds.']`

</aside>

</div>
