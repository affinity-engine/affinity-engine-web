Finally, let's say that you plan to have one or more translations for your game. The Affinity Engine supports this through the `translator-ember-intl` plugin. Simply go to `my-project/translations/en-us.yaml` and paste in the following:

```yaml
textTutorial:
  scene1:
    title: "Text Tutorial"
    diy1: "Oh, &sung; <em style='color: pink; ont-size: 200%;'>how exciting!</em> &sung; We're starting the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_(literary_theory)' target='_blank'>text</a> tutorial."
    ember1: "Wait? [[cb shake 1000 15deg]] [[pause 1000]] Did you say we're starting the [[cb jump 1000 height]] [[pause 1000]] best tutorial?"
    diy2: "Well, kind of! We're starting the [[#rate 3]] text [[/rate]] tutorial, but words are one of my favorite things."
```

Then in your scene you can reference these lines using dot notation, such as `textTutorial.scene1.diy1`:

```js
const shake = (duration, rotation) => {
  script.layer('stage').transition({ effect: { rotateZ: rotation }, duration: duration / 8, loop: 4, easing: 'easeInOutSine' });
}
const jump = (duration) => {
  script.layer('stage').transition({ effect: { translateY: '-15%' }, duration: duration / 8, loop: 4, easing: 'easeInOutSine' });
}

script.text("textTutorial.scene1.title", { static: true, classNames: ['ae-paper ae-caption ae-caption-center'] });
yield diy._.text("textTutorial.scene1.diy1");
yield ember._.text("textTutorial.scene1.ember1", { callbacks: { shake, jump } });
yield diy._.text("textTutorial.scene1.diy2");
```
