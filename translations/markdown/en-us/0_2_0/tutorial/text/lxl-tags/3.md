But wait, did you notice how everything is slower after the tag opens. That's not what we want! Let's return it to its normal rate by closing the tag:

```js
yield diy._.text("Well, kind of! We're starting the [[#rate 3]] text [[/rate]] tutorial, but it's also the next one.");
```

Note how we prefix `rate` with a `#`. That tells `ember-letter-by-letter` that the tag is an _opening_ tag and will have an accompanying _closing_ tag. The `/` at the start of `[[/rate]]` tells `ember-letter-by-letter` that this is the closing tag.
