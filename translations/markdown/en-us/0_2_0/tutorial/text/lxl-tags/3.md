Now let's say we want 'about' to be written quickly, but for it to return to its normal rate afterwards. We can do that by closing the tag:

```js
yield diy._.text("How [[#rate 5]] about [[/rate]] now?");
```

Note how we prefix `rate` with a `#`. That tells `ember-letter-by-letter` that the tag is an _opening_ tag and will have an accompanying _closing_ tag. The `/` at the start of `[[/rate]]` tells `ember-letter-by-letter` that this is the closing tag.
