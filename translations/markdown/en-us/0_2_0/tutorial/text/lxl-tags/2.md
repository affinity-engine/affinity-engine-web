Now let's say we want Diy to speak more slowly when they repeat themselves. We can do that with the `rate` tag:

```js
yield diy._.text("Well, kind of! We're starting the [[rate 3]] text tutorial, but words are one of my favorite things.");
```

Here, we're defining the tag the same way, with `[[]]`. The argument we provide is telling `ember-letter-by-letter` how many letters to write each second.
