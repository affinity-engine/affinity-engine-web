Affinity Engine games are just highly interactive web pages, and because of that, we can treat our text like normal HTML. This includes using inline [HTML tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference), and [character entities](https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref).

Let's start by making Diy's opening line a little more emphatic with the `<em>` tag:

```js
yield diy._.text("Oh, <em>how exciting!</em> We're starting the text tutorial.");
```
