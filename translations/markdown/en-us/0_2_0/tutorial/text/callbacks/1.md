While `lxl-tags` are great at changing the behavior of the text itself, sometimes we want to trigger something outside of the text box. We can do this using _callbacks_. For instance, let's say that we want the whole screen to flash and spin excitedly while Ember is talking:

```js
const flash = (duration, loops) => {
  script.layer('stage').transition({ effect: { opacity: 0 }, duration: duration / (loops * 2), loop: loops });
}
const spin = (duration) => {
  script.layer('stage').transition({ effect: { rotateZ: '360deg' }, duration: duration });
}
yield ember._.text("Wait? [[cb flash 1000 2]] [[pause 1000]] Did you say we're starting the [[cb spin 1000]] [[pause 1000]] next tutorial?", { callbacks: { flash, spin } });
```

</div>

# Callbacks

In computer programming, a callback refers to a function that is passed into another function and then called when certain criteria are met. In the case of _text callbacks_, the callback is executed when `ember-letter-by-letter` reaches the tag.
