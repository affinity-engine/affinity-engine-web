While `lxl-tags` are great at changing the behavior of the text itself, sometimes we want something to trigger something outside of the text box. We can do this using _callbacks_. For instance, let's say that we want the whole screen to shake excitedly while Ember is talking:

```js
const shake = (duration, rotation) => {
  script.layer('stage').transition({ effect: { rotateZ: rotation }, duration: duration / 8, loop: 4, easing: 'easeInOutSine' });
}
const jump = (duration) => {
  script.layer('stage').transition({ effect: { translateY: '-15%' }, duration: duration / 8, loop: 4, easing: 'easeInOutSine' });
}
yield ember._.text("Wait? [[cb shake 1000 15deg]] [[pause 1000]] Did you say we're starting the [[cb jump 1000 height]] [[pause 1000]] best tutorial?", { callbacks: { shake, jump } });
```

</div>

# Callbacks

In computer programming, a callback refers to a function that is passed into another function and then called when certain criteria are met. In the case of _text callbacks_, the callback is executed when `ember-letter-by-letter` reaches the tag.
