First off, let's look at the `static` attribute. All our previous examples of a `text` direction would close when you clicked or tapped on them. Sometime however, you'll want a text to remain fixed to the screen. That's where `static` comes in! In the below example, we'll add a static text to the top of the screen describing the scene:

```js
. . . .

export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    const diy = script.character('diy');
    const ember = script.character('ember');

    script.text("Text Tutorial"), { static: true, classNames: ['ae-paper ae-caption ae-caption-center'] };

    yield diy._.text("Oh, how exciting! We're starting the text tutorial.");
    . . . .
  })
});
```
