A lot like attributes, _commands_ change the way a direction behaves. However, while attributes _define_ a direction's qualities, commands tell directions what _to do_.  For instance, the `transition` command will animate the text:

```js
yield script.text("Mic test, mic test.", { caption: 'Diy' });
script.text("Hearing you loud and clear!", { caption: 'Ember', captionPosition: 'right' }).transition({ effect: { opacity: 0.5 }, duration: 500 });
```

In this case, the text will fade from `opacity` 1 (the default) to `opacity` 0.5 over 500 milliseconds (1/2 a second).
