You can also chain transitions together using a `.` and they'll execute one after the next:

```js
yield script.text("Mic test, mic test.", { caption: 'Diy' });
script.text("Hearing you loud and clear!", { caption: 'Ember', captionPosition: 'right' }).transition({ effect: { opacity: 0.5 }, duration: 500 }).transition({ effect: { opacity: 1 }, duration: 500, loop: 3 });
```

In this case, we also added a `loop` that will transition between `opacity` 0.5 and 1 for 3 times before completing.
