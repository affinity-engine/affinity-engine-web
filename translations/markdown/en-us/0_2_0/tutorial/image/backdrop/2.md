Notice how it's not centered? We can use the `backdrop` direction, which is a sub-set of the `image` direction. It behaves a little differently, including centering the backdrop by default:

```js
// affinity-engine/fixtures/backdrop
export default [{
  id: 'bedroom',
  attrs: {
    keyframe: 'diy-bedroom',
    height: 150
  }
}]
```

And then we change the direction like so:

```js
script.backdrop('bedroom').fadeIn();
```
