The Affinity Engine can also play sounds. You can learn more about the `sound` direction [here](/#/api/stage/directions/sound).

In the following tutorials, we'll be using the song Spacewolf by [Matt Oakley](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Matt_Oakley/). Download it [here](https://github.com/affinity-engine/affinity-engine-web/tree/master/public/tutorial) and put it into your `/public/tutorial` folder. Next, make a sound fixture for it:

```js
// affinity-engine/fixtures/sounds.js
export default [{
  id: 'spacewolf',
  attrs: {
    src: 'tutorial/spacewolf.mp3'
  }
}];
```

And then a simple scene:

```js
import { Scene } from 'affinity-engine-stage';
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';

export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    script.sound('spacewolf');
  })
});
```
