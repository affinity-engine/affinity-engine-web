We've learned a lot! And now, just one more tutorial. We're gonna learn how to publish our game!

There are a few approaches to this! Let's go over them.

### Upload the game to Github Pages (totally free!)

First, [create a Github repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) for your game. You can do it with just a few clicks of a button.

Then in your console run the following command:

```bash
ember install ember-cli-github-pages
git remote add origin git@github.com:my-github-username/my-github-repo.git
git push -u origin master
```

Then in your `package.json` file, look for `scripts` and replace it like so:

```js
"scripts": {
  "build": "ember build",
  "start": "ember server",
  "test": "ember test",
  "deploy": "ember github-pages:commit --message \"Deploy gh-pages from commit $(git rev-parse HEAD)\" --environment=production; git push; git checkout -"
},
```

Save the changes to that file and then run the following command in your console:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Added ember-cli-github-pages addon"
git push origin master
git checkout --orphan gh-pages && rm -rf `bash -c "ls -a | grep -vE '\.gitignore|\.git|node_modules|bower_components|(^[.]{1,2}/?$)'"` && touch .gitkeep && git add -A && git commit -m "initial gh-pages commit"
npm run deploy
git push origin gh-pages:gh-pages
git checkout master
```

Wait a few minutes, and then check it out! The game should be live at a url like: `http://my-github-username.github.io/my-github-repo/`.

If you want to use a custom domain, such as `http://www.mygame.com`, [Github supports that too](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/)!


### Upload the game to a server

First, run this command in your console:

```bash
ember build --environment=production
```

This will create a `dist` folder, which you can then upload to a server. Mozilla has a great tutorial for that [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Upload_files_to_a_web_server).

### (Experimental) Create a desktop or mobile app

If you want your game to be a cross-platform desktop app, you can package it using [`emeber-electron`](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/ember-electron).

If you want it to be a native mobile app, you can package it using [`corber`](https://github.com/isleofcode/corber).

Both of these approaches are as of yet untested.
