Fixtures are immutable mini-configurations that you can use to define reoccurring game elements, such as characters and sound effects. After defining them, we're able to reuse them throughout our game by simply referencing their `id`. Like our config, our fixtures are simple nested POJOs:

```js
export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  fixtures: {
    characters: [{
      id: 'diy',
      attrs: {
        name: 'Diy',
        height: 90
      }
    }, {
      id: 'ember',
      attrs: {
        name: 'Ember',
        height: 87
      }
    }],
    backdrops: [{
      id: 'bedroom',
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Their bedroom'
      }
    }]
  }
});
```

```hbs
{{affinity-engine fixtures=fixtures}}
```
