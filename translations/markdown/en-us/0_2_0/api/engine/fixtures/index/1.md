Fixtures are mini-configurations for reoccurring elements in your game, such as characters, backdrops, sounds effects, and songs. After defining them, you'll be able to reuse them throughout your game by simply referencing their `id`. Like your config, your fixtures are simple POJOs:

```js
export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  fixtures: {
    characters: [{
      id: 'diy',
      attrs: {
        name: 'Diy',
        height: 90
      }
    }, {
      id: 'ember',
      attrs: {
        name: 'Ember',
        height: 87
      }
    }],
    backdrops: [{
      id: 'bedroom',
      attrs: {
        caption: 'Their bedroom'
      }
    }]
  }
});
```

```hbs
{{affinity-engine fixtures=fixtures}}
```
