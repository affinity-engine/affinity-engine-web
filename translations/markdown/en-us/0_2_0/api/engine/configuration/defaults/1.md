At the highest level of configuration are your module's default values. Although you do not define these values yourself (unless you're making a module), it's worth understanding how they interact with your game-defined configs. For instance, the `affinity-engine` module has a default configuration that looks something like this:

```js
export default {
  priority: 0,
  children: {
    attrs: {
      animator: 'jquery',
      classNames: ['ae-paper', 'ae-block']
    }
  }
};
```

Note that it defines the `animator` as `jquery`. This means that unless you or another module specifies something else, your engine will use `jquery` to animate everything.

In the `affinity-engine-plugin-animator-velocity` plugin, the config looks something like this:

```js
export default {
  priority: 1,
  children: {
    attrs: {
      animator: 'velocity'
    }
  }
};
```

Now both the `affinity-engine` config and the `affinity-engine-plugin-animator-velocity` config define `animator`. If you include both in your project, then `affinity-engine-plugin-animator-velocity`'s config will win this conflict, since it has a higher `priority` (1 vs 0). That means that your engine will use `velocity` instead of `jquery`. However, since `affinity-engine-plugin-animator-velocity` does not specify a `classNames`, the engine will continue using the default defined in the `affinity-engine` config.
