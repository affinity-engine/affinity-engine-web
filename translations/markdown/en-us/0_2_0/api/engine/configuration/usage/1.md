##### Defining Your Config

Configs are nested POJOs. For instance, if you wanted to configure `component.stage.direction.menu`, `component.stage.direction.text`, and `component.menuBar`:

```js
export default {
  component: {
    menuBar: {
      . . . .
    },
    stage: {
      direction: {
        menu: {
          . . . .
        },
        text: {
          . . . .
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can configure everything using `all`:

```js
export default {
  all: {
    . . . .
  }
}
```

###### `attrs`

To configure attributes, nest them within an `attrs` POJO:

```js
export default {
  all: {
    attrs: {
      animator: 'velocity',
      captionPosition: 'right'
    }
  }
}
```

###### Other configurables

Some modules allow you to configure other aspects of your game. For instance, the `stage` module unlocks `links`. These are defined alongside `attrs`:

```js
export default {
  all: {
    attrs: {
      animator: 'velocity',
      captionPosition: 'right'
    },
    links: {
      menu: {
        attrs: {
          menuColumns: ['ae-coastal', 'ae-full']
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### Defining Your Config in a Controller

The simplest way to use your config is to define it within the controller that manages your `affinity-engine`. For instance, if your engine is rendered in `templates/application.hbs` template, then you can define your config in `controllers/application.js`. If that controller doesn't exist yet, you can use Ember CLI's command line generator:

```bash
ember generate controller application
```

Then within the controller you would define the config like so:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  myConfig: {
    all: {
      attrs: {
        animator: 'popmotion'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

And finally, you'd pass the config into the engine through the `application.hbs` template:

```hbs
{{#affinity-engine config=myConfig as |engine|}}
  . . . .
{{/affinity-engine}}
```

If you have other engines running, you can define unique configs for each one in their respective controllers. If you want multiple engines on a single controller, you can even define multiple configs on that controller under different keys.

##### Sharing Your Config

Often you'll want to use a single config for all your engines. You can do that by defining your config within the `affinity-engine/config.js` file. For instance:

```js
// my-app/affinity-engine/config.js

export default {
  all: {
    attrs: {
      animator: 'popmotion'
    }
  }
}
```

Note the `export default` in front of the config. This is essential, as it turns your config into a module that can be imported into any/all of your controllers:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';
import config from 'my-game/affinity-engine/config';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  myConfig: config
});
```
