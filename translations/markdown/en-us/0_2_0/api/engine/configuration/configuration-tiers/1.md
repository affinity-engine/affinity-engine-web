All modules have _configuration tiers_ which determine which configuration to use in case of a conflict. These tiers allow us to specify general theming for our project, with specific overrides when we need it. For instance, the `text` direction has configuration tiers that look like this:

* component.stage.direction.text
* text
* component.stage.direction.prompt
* prompt
* component.stage.direction.all
* component.stage.all
* all

If our config then looked like this:

```js
export default {
  all: {
    attrs: {
      animator: 'velocity'
    }
  },
  component: {
    stage: {
      direction: {
        text: {
          attrs: {
            animator: 'popmotion'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

Then `text` directions would use `animator: popmotion`, since `component.stage.direction.text` is a higher tier than `all`.
