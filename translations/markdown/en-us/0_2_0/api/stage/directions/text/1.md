Renders a text box. It uses the [`ember-letter-by-letter` addon](http://null-null-null.github.io/ember-letter-by-letter/), which by default will cause the text to appear one letter at a time. In addition, `ember-letter-by-letter` supports [`lxl-tags`](http://null-null-null.github.io/ember-letter-by-letter/#/lxl-tags) that change its behavior, such as pausing the text, changing its tween effects, speeding it up or slowing it down, or causing the whole text block to appear instantly after a certain point. `lxl-tags` can add a lot of character to your dialogue. Finally, you can also use HTML tags such as `<a></a>` to create a link or `<strong></strong>` to make the text bold.
