What if you want to configure your game to use `velocity` for most animations, but you wanted `popmotion` to handle your text animations? That's possible using configuration tiers like so:

```js
{
  animationLibrary: 'velocity',
  component: {
    stage: {
      direction: {
        text: {
          animationLibrary: 'popmotion'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we first specify a global configuration with `animationLibrary: 'velocity'`, and then we provide a specific override just for the `text` direction. When a module lists what attributes you can configure, it'll also let you know what configuration tiers it's observing and in what order. When determining its value, the module will check to see if its highest priority tier is set. If not, it checks the next highest, all the way down to the lowest priority.
