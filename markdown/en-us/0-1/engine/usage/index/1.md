Now that we've created an Ember.js project and installed the `affinity-engine` module, we're ready to actually implement it in our app. In this chapter, we'll learn how to do just that. We'll also learn that while the Affinity Engine itself is fairly light-weight, it has the important job of coordinating the many modules we're using. To this end, we'll also look into ways to configure the engine to work in a variety of scenarios.

In the [first section](/engine/usage/basic-routing), we'll learn a little about Ember.js routes, templates, and the `affinity-engine` component. This section provides a simple implementation for the engine, as well as links to further reading if you're interested in learning more about Ember.js.

After that, we'll learn about [the arguments](/engine/usage/arguments) that can be passed into the `affinity-engine` component to configure it. These include `config`, `fixtures`, `engineId`, and `isFocused`.

Finally, we'll introduce ourselves to the [block params](/engine/usage/block-params) that the `affinity-engine` component exposes, learning how to use these params to coordinate with child modules.
